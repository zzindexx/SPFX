# SPFX
This repository will contain my SharePoint SPFX samples. They are all generated with on-premises support and were tested with SharePoint Server 2019

## Current SharePoint solution
* [react-phonebook](https://github.com/zzindexx/SPFX/tree/master/SharePoint/react-phonebook) - a simple phonebook with organizational structure tree to find people in organization
* [react-birthdaylist](https://github.com/zzindexx/SPFX/tree/master/SharePoint/react-birthdaylist) - web part displaying the birthdays for today, this week or this month
